# celsiusnarhwal/tag-action-release

Whenever you publish a [semver](https://semver.org)-tagged release, this GitHub Action will automatically tag the
associated commit with the matching major version. For example, if you publish a release tagged `v1.2.3`, this action
will apply the `v1` tag to the associated commit.
